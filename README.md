# Coronavirus Data Analysis

In this project we will perform data analysis on coronavirus european and greek data from January 2020 to December 2021. Data are taken from the official ECDC site [ https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/covid-19/data ], the official EODY site [ https://eody.gov.gr/ ] and the research page [ https://www.stelios67pi.eu/ ].

Project is divided in four tasks.

#### Task 01:
We analyze GR positivity rate and the probability distribution of 25 EU countries, during Greece's maximum rate in the end of 2020 and 2021. Here we are interested in time periods W45-W50 2020 and W45-W50 2021, as the end of both years marked significant change in the course of the pandemic.

#### Task 02:
We perform a Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, to see whether both 2020 & 2021 data come from the same distribution. We run both parametric and non -parametric tests to obtain confidence intervals.

#### Task 03:
We run non-parametric bootstrap, testing how statistically significant GR positivity rate is, compared to the EU one. We pick a time period of 12 weeks for our test, starting from September 2020 and ending around the end of November 2020. Again, this period was extremely crucial to the pandemic course for Greece.

#### Task 04:
We analyze Greece positivity rate full trajectory as a time series. We test the series for stability using various algorithms and graphical methods. Stability in a time series is crucial if we want to go forward and make predictions.
